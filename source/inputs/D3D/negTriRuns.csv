# This is a HEAT input file responsible for:
# 1) assigning intersection PFCs to each heat flux calculation PFC
# 2) assigning MapDirection to each PFC
# 3) assigning the timesteps to use each PFC for
#
# you can use colons (:) to insert a range of timesteps or to insert multiple intersects
# but each PFC needs its own line (and sometimes two if you need to trace in both directions)
# commas are the delimiter here, so don't use them inside columns or you'll break pandas
#
# Example
# 100:105, E-ED1450-013, -1, E-ED1450-013:E-ED1390-003:E-ED1450-071
#
# this would calculate HF on E-ED1450-013 for all (available) timesteps between
# 100ms and 105ms, checking for intersections with E-ED1450-013, E-ED1390-003,
# and E-ED1450-071, with traces running in the reversed MapDirection
# 40-1783_2 TILE UPPER
# 40-1782_3 TILE LOWER TYPE A0
