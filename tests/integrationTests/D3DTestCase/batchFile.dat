#HEAT batchFile
#For use when running HEAT in terminal / batch mode.  Each line is a new entry.
#
# The fist line of every batchFile should be (uncommented):
# MachFlag, Tag, Shot, TimeStep, GEQDSK, CAD, PFC, Input, Output
#
#===Column variables are defined as follows
# MachFlag: machine specific flag.
#           can be 'd3d','nstx','st40','step','sparc','west','kstar'
#
# Tag:  user specified tag to label the simulation by.  Tags represent
#       independent HEAT runs.  For time varying discharges with multiple
#       GEQDSK files, tag should be repeated on multiple lines with the 
#       TimeStep column changing.
#
# Shot:  pulse number to use for saving HEAT output (MachFlag_Shot).  Default is to
#        allow for 6 sig figs of shot numbers.  SigFigs can be changed in engineClass
#        object initialization function call.
#
# TimeStep: Timestep that the equilibrium defined in "GEQDSK" column corresponds
#           to.  GEQDSKs can be named in multiple formats, but the TimeStep in 
#           this row is what is used by HEAT.  For time varying discharges, tag 
#           should be repeated on multiple lines with the TimeStep column changing.
#           Timestep units are [s].  Default is to allow for 9 SigFigs after the
#           radix, which corresponds to nanosecond resolution (defined in engineClass
#           initialization function call)
#
# GEQDSK:  magnetic equilibrium file (ie EFIT) in GEQDSK format
#          Psi should be in units of Wb/rad (divide by 2pi) and the Bt0, Fpol, Psi
#          and Ip values should reflect COCOS.
#
# CAD: CAD file for the tag.  Note that HEAT will use the first CAD file provided
#      in for each tag.  Subsequent lines in that tag are ignored.  In other words,
#      there can only be one CAD file per tag.  Can be STEP, IGES, or FCStd formats.
#
# PFC: PFC file for the tag.  Note that HEAT will use the first PFC file provided
#      in for each tag.  Subsequent lines in that tag are ignored.  In other words,
#      there can only be one PFC file per tag.
#
# INPUT: Input file for the tag.  Input files can be time varying, but only the
#        HF Variables will be read at each timestep.
#
# Output: Defines what output HEAT should calculate.  Options are:
#         -hfOpt   optical heat flux point cloud
#         -hfGyro  gyro orbit heat flux point cloud
#         -hfRad   radiated power heat flux point cloud
#         -B       magnetic field glyph cloud
#         -psiN    normalized poloidal flux point cloud
#         -pwrDir  powerDir point cloud
#         -bdotn   bdotn point cloud
#         -norm    normal vector glyph cloud
#         -T       temperature
#
#       for multiple outputs, separate options with : (ie hfOpt:psi:T).  Note
#       that HEAT will use the first options list provided for each tag.
#       Subsequent lines in that tag are ignored.  In other words, there can
#       only be one set of options per tag.
#
#
# Once you have a batchFile, you need to save all input files in the following
# directory structure, where <path> is wherever the batchFile is and <MachFlag>
# is the machine name (ie nstx):
# <path>/batchFile.dat
# <path>/<MachFlag>/GEQDSK
# <path>/<MachFlag>/CAD
# <path>/<MachFlag>/PFC
# <path>/<MachFlag>/Input
#
#  Example line for DIII-D run for pulse 154859 at timestep 4300 ms:
#MachFlag, Tag, Shot, TimeStep, GEQDSK, CAD, PFC, Input, Output
#d3d, plasma3D, 154859, 4300, g154859.04300, d3d_sector.step, PFCinput.csv, D3D_input.csv, hfOpt
#
# And the directory structure would look like this
# <path>/batchFile.dat
# <path>/d3d/g154859.04300
# <path>/d3d/d3d_sector.step
# <path>/d3d/PFCinput.csv
# <path>/d3d/D3D_input.csv
#
#
#
#
MachFlag, Tag, Shot, TimeStep, GEQDSK, CAD, PFC, Input, Output
d3d, plasma3D, 154859, 4300, g154859.04300, d3d_sector.step, PFCinput.csv, D3D_input.csv, hfOpt
