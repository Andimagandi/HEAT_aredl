HEAT via the appImage
#####################

There is no longer support for using the Linux appImage in HEAT.  Docker provides a superior user interface,
enables the container to be stashed in the dockerhub repo, and can run on Linux, macOS, and windows.  There
is no performance difference between docker and appImage.  We therefore now only support docker containers.
If this greatly inconveniences you, please let us know by raising an issue on the HEAT github page.
